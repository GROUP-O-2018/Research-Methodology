	\paragraph{}
	Student Hall Registration is the process where by every student has to register at his/her hall of attachment at the beginning of the first year after their admission at Makerere University.
	However for the govt students and the private-residents have to register every academic year for their program for instance govt-residents have to register for the change of the rooms and the non-residents have to also register for their accounts updates(for example if the student wants to change the mobile money number where he/she receives the upkeep from).
	The current system involves a lot of paper work where every student has to collect forms from his/her hall of residence which is time consuming and  doesn't favor the evening students who normally report at 5:00pm yet hall offices operate from 8:00am  to 4:30pm.
